== COMPILE FROM SOURCE ==

=== Delphi ===
This package has been written in Object Pascal with Delphi 2007. If you don't have 
Delphi, you should be able to use the free Turbo version (http://www.turboexplorer.com).

=== Flexcel library ===
My own code is free (GPLv2 with exception, see inst/License) but I made also use of a 
third party component (Flexcel) which I am not allowed to distribute in source form. 
To compile xlsReadWrite.dll from source you will need a developer license of this libray. 
It currently costs € 75.= and is available here: http://www.tmssoftware.com/. I have no 
connection with this company apart from being a customer.

=== Changes in flexcel ===
In Flexcel I made the following (small) changes:
 * TFlexCelImport and TXLSAdapter are derived from TObject instead of TComponent.
   (adapt the correspondending Create methods).
 * Flexcel has quite a lot of different folders. I just copied all .pas, .inc and
   .res files in a single folder and set a path to this folder in Delphi.


== SOME DETAILS ==

In order to make R packages with Delphi I had to translate the (LGPL'ed) C header 
files to pascal interface units. This is a separate project (RHeaders4Delphi) and 
can be downloaded on the treetron.googlepages website.

My experience shows that Delphi works very well in conjunction with R. It's great 
fun, easy to debug and pascal code doesn't hurt they eyes...

Unfortunately Delphi doesn't have direct crossplatform support. I would have to
do a Linux port using Kylix or FreePascal. If someone of you has such a need and 
would be ready to (partly) act as a sponsor, it probably will happen sooner!
A Mac port could be done but is unlikely to happen without external funding.
