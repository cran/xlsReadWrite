License things

xlsReadWrite is published under GPLv2 with an exception to link the non-free 
component library Flexcel. This exception makes, that the package as a whole is 
not GPL. To compile for yourself you have to buy the Flexcel code, but then, on 
your own you go...

xlsReadWrite*Pro* is a shareware package. To use it (after a trial period) you
are obliged to register it for a (small) fee. While the source code is not
generally available, it can be licensed also. Just ask.

Both packages are (from an R POV) non-free non-standard packages. They interface
R through LGPL'ed header files only and are in line with the explicit statement
that non-free packages can exist and are tolerated (though not encouraged).


=================
Technical details

Well, I am quite proud to tell, that these packages have been made with Delphi
(a Pascal dialect) and not with the usual languages C (or C++ or Fortran).
The Delphi-R interface is a separate project which is fully GPLv2 licensed and
can be downloaded (RHeaders4Delphi.zip) on the treetron.googlepages website.

My experience shows that it is easy to use Delphi in conjunction with R.
The big problem however is, that Delphi doesn't have crossplatform support.
It could be addressed with the FreePascal compiler, which I tried out for
2 days and had some partial success. But as I currently don't have a personal
need to read Excelfiles on the Linux platform this has to wait. If someone
is interested in this and ready to commission such a development, please ask.
I certainly would be interested to make this library a crossplatform thing.


=================
Uninstall xlsReadWrite*Pro*

To uninstall xlsReadWritePro just delete the folder <R_HOME>/library/xlsReadWritePro. 
There is an entry (HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{BC056A6C-8CAD-4F9D-9523-44611EB835F7) 
in the registry which is used for the trial period. You can leave it there (it doesn't 
do any harm) or you can delete this key manually with the regedit tool. The entry does
contain a subfolder "Info" with (normally) 3 Keys (D1, D2, D3). Check if this is correct
and don't delete the key if not. WARNING: only use the regedit tool and/or modify the 
registry if you know how this works, inappropriate use can damage your system.
